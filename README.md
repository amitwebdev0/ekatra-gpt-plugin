The provided code is a Node.js server that uses the Express.js framework and several other libraries to create an automated educational chatbot service that interacts with users through WhatsApp and schedules courses using the OpenAI GPT-3 model as a conversation assistant. The application is designed to provide courses on different topics, with the courses and lessons hardcoded into the system. Here's a breakdown of what the server does:

1. **Setup and Configuration**: The server begins by importing necessary dependencies and setting up an Express.js application. It specifies a port (3000) and configures the app to parse incoming requests with URL-encoded and JSON payloads using the `body-parser` middleware.

2. **Course Data**: It then defines a hardcoded list of available courses and their respective lessons.

3. **Scheduled Job**: A job is scheduled using the `node-schedule` library to run every day at 9AM. This job:

   - Uses the GPT-3 model (referred to as ChatGPT plugin in the code) to prompt the user to select a course from the available options.
   - Processes the course selection and extracts the selected course.
   - Generates a 3-5 day course structure for the selected course.
   - Sends the generated course structure back through the GPT-3 model for processing.
   - Sends the completed course structure to a specified WhatsApp number.

4. **WhatsApp Message Handling**: The server has an endpoint `/webhook` that handles incoming POST requests. This endpoint is presumably used to receive incoming messages from WhatsApp.

   - It extracts relevant information from the incoming message.
   - Processes the incoming message using the GPT-3 model.
   - Sends the response from the GPT-3 model back to WhatsApp.

5. **Utility Functions**: There are several utility functions defined to perform specific tasks such as processing messages with the GPT-3 model, processing course selection, extracting the selected course, generating course structure, processing the course structure, and sending messages or courses to WhatsApp.

6. **Server Startup**: Finally, the server starts listening on the specified port and logs a message to the console.

The actual implementations of certain methods, such as `processMessageWithChatGPT`, `extractSelectedCourse`, `generateCourseStructure`, `sendCourseToWhatsApp`, and `sendResponseToWhatsApp`, are placeholders that need to be replaced with actual implementations.

The GPT-3 model is used here as a conversational assistant to facilitate the selection and structure of the courses. The assumption is that the GPT-3 model will be able to generate appropriate responses to prompts related to course selection and structuring. The application interacts with GPT-3 using the OpenAI API, and the conversation with the model is framed as a series of messages between two roles: 'system' and 'user'.

Please note that the code assumes the existence of an API endpoint for the ChatGPT plugin and WhatsApp API library or service to send messages. It also expects you to replace 'YOUR_PLUGIN_API_KEY' with your actual OpenAI API key. You'd need to have these services properly configured and available for the code to function as intended.
